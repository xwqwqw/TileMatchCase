The project employs various design patterns such as observer, state, 
flyweight, and finally singleton. Additionally, there is a 
level editor in the project, making the addition of new levels quite straightforward. 
All core objects in the game have states, 
which are efficiently utilized through a pooling system. 
Except for the initial entry, there is no loading in the game, and the scene never reloads.
This ensures a seamless gaming experience, even on older devices.

The level editor operates through an overlay button. 
Using arrow keys within the editor, we can move and place tiles, 
and later procedurally assign them. Furthermore, the editor allows the 
stacking of different layers or complete manual control if desired.

The project incorporates a custom tweening library, 
developed by myself, specifically for UI animations. 

Additionally, there is a logging system that customizes Unity logs, 
adding a verbose and release mode. This allows us to selectively disable unnecessary logs, 
similar to Google's external dependency manager, providing better control over log outputs.


Known Issue: There is visual problem when you play the game too fast it 
happens because of the event calls.
